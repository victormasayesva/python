For this assignment you should read the task, then below the task do what it asks you to do
based on what the task tells you do first.
EXAMPLE TASK:
'''
#EX) Declare a variable set to 3. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 0.
i = 3;
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1

'''While Loops'''
#1) Declare a variable set to 4. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 1.
i=4;
while i > 0:
    print (i)
    i -= 1
    
return


#2) Declare a variable set to 14. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and increments the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 20.
i=14;
while i < 0:
    print (i)
    i -= 20
return
#3) Declare a variable set to 55. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#   you just created. Then make an if statement that makes the loop break when
#   the variable is equal to 50. 
i=55;
while i <= 0:
    print (i)
    i -= 50
return

'''For Loops'''
#4) Create a list named sports. Put three sports into the list. Create
#   a for loop that prints each sport in the list
def sports (sport):
    for  in sport
    print(x)
    print ("DONE")
    return

listOsport = ["dance", "soccer", "swim"]
sports(listOsport)

#5) Create a for loop that loops through each letter in a string of one of your
#   favorite songs. Each iteration should print should a letter of the word. 
def Songs (song):
    for in song
    print (x)
    print ("DONE")
    return 


listOsong = ["s","u","p","e","r","m","a","n"]
songs(listOsong)
#6) Create a list named movies. Put five of your favorite movies into the list.
#   However, make sure one of the movies is Avatar. 
#   Create a for loop that iterates over the list. In the loop print the movie
#   being looped over, but create an if statement that breaks out of the 
#   loop if it is Avatar.
def movies (movie):
    for in movie
    print(x)
    print("DONE")
    if (x = "Avatar")
    return 

listOmovie = ["Billy Madison", "Frozen", "Miracle on Ice", "Rudy", "Avatar"]
movies(listOmovie)
