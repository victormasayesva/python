Objective:
This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file.
-A function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-A function that takes input from the user which will be each letter guessed
-A function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string.
-We need to create the various variables to store the users inputted data\
   -We need a variable for the word the computer picks
   -We need to create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-We need to display an intro to the program
-Need to build a repetetive system, so that the user can keep guessing letters
-If the player guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, until they lose.
-We will add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
